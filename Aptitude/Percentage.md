## Meaning of Percentage

- **Percentage** means "part per hundred." The symbol (%) means divide by 100.
- If asked for 25%, it is calculated as 25/100.
- "Of" in percentage problems means multiplication.

## Common Percentage Fractions

| Fraction  | Percentage |
|:----------|:-----------|
| 1/2       | 50%        |
| 1/3       | 33.33%     |
| 1/4       | 25%        |
| 1/5       | 20%        |
| 1/10      | 10%        |
| 3/4       | 75%        |
| 1/8       | 12.5%      |

- For example, 1/4 of a quantity is 25% of it.

## Quick Methods to Find Percentages

- 10% of a number: Move decimal one place left.  
  - E.g. 10% of 260 = 26
- 1% of a number: Move decimal two places left.  
  - E.g. 1% of 693 = 6.93
- To get 20%, first find 10% then double it.
- Any x%: Express as sum or difference of multiples of 10% and 1%  
  - E.g. 39% of 260 = (10% × 4) − 1% = 104 − 2.6 = 101.4

## Useful Tricks for Calculating Specific Percentages

- If asked for "What percent is A of B":  
  - Formula: (A / B) * 100
- If 56% of y is 182, value of y:  
  - y = (182 * 100) / 56
- If 15% of y = 21% of z, 12.5% of y is __% of z:  
  - Use ratio and cross multiplication.

## Typical Percentage-Based Word Problems

### Increasing & Decreasing Percentage

- If price increases by p%, then decreases by p%, the net effect is always a decrease.  
  - Net change = -(p^2 / 100) %
- If price of wheat is 30% more than rice, the price of rice is less than wheat by:  
  - Example: Wheat = 100; Rice = 70  
  - Wheat is (100 - 70) = 30 more than rice  
  - Relative to rice: (30 / 70) * 100 = 42.857%  
  - So wheat is 42.86% more expensive.

### Composite Problems

- If price increases by x%, required reduction in quantity to keep expenditure constant = (x / (100 + x)) * 100 %

### Election Problems

- If two candidates contest and one loses by N votes, total votes can be calculated by forming equations.

### Sets/Double Counting

- E.g. 15% fail in Science, 25% fail in Maths, 10% fail in both:  
  - Passed in both = 100% - (15 + 25 - 10) = 70%

---

## Key Points & Revision

- Know percentage-equivalent fractions for quicker calculation.
- For 'how much less/more', base is always the value being compared TO.
- Additive and subtractive percent changes always yield a net percent drop.
- For word problems, assume convenient numbers (usually 100).

## Sample Problems with Solutions

### 1. Find y if 56% of y = 182

(56/100) * y = 182  
=> y = (182 * 100) / 56 = 325

---

### 2. What percent is 42kg of 336kg?

(42 / 336) * 100 = 12.5%

---

### 3. If 15% of Y = 21% of Z, then 12.5% of Y is what percent of Z?

(15/100) * Y = (21/100) * Z  
=> Y / Z = 21 / 15  

Now, (12.5/100) * Y = (x/100) * Z  

=> (12.5/100) * (21/15) * Z = (x/100) * Z  
=> x = (21/15) * 12.5 = 17.5%

---

### 4. Price of rice is 30% less than wheat, find percent more for wheat than rice.

Let wheat = 100; rice = 70.  
Wheat is 100 - 70 = 30 more than rice.  
Relative to rice: (30 / 70) * 100 = 42.857%  
So, wheat is 42.86% more expensive.

---

### 5. Price is first increased by 10% and then decreased by 10%.

Let price = 100.  
After +10%: 110  
After -10% of 110 = 11 → Net = 99  
Thus, decrease = 1% (or ₹1).

---

### 6. If price rises by 25%, by what % should a person reduce consumption to keep spending same?

Initial price = 100, consumption = 1  
New price = 125, let new consumption = c  

100 * 1 = 125 * c  
=> c = 0.8  

Reduction = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2  
% reduction = (0.2 / 1) * 100 = 20%

---

### 7. Exam Maximum Marks Problems

40% needed to pass, a student gets 20 marks and fails by 40.  

Passing marks = 20 + 40 = 60  
If 40% marks = 60, total = 60 / 0.4 = 150

---

### 8. Sets Problem

15% fail in science, 25% fail in maths, 10% fail both.  

% passed in both = 100 - (15 + 25 - 10) = 70%

---

### 9. Price Change, Quantity Bought

If by decreasing price by 20%, 10kg more can be bought for ₹100, original price?

Let price = P, quantity = Q.  

100 = Q * P (before)  
100 = (Q + 10) * (0.8 * P) (after)  

Solve for P.

---

### 10. Salary Comparison

If A’s salary is 50% more than B’s, by what % is B’s less than A’s?  

Let B = 100, A = 150  
Difference = 50  

As % of A: (50 / 150) * 100 = 33.33%

---

### 11. Election Example

40% votes for losing candidate, lost by 1000 votes.  

Let total votes = x.  
Winner = 60% of x, Loser = 40% of x  
Difference = 20% of x = 1000 → x = 5000

---

## Final Tips

- Always read carefully to decide what is being asked.
- In comparison questions, base value is crucial.
- For sets, use inclusion-exclusion principle.
- Practice mental arithmetic shortcuts.
