## Core Formulas

- Use the **Y-shaped diagram** (DST) to remember formulas:

  - Distance = Speed × Time
  - Speed = Distance ÷ Time
  - Time = Distance ÷ Speed

- Write 'D' at the top, 'S' and 'T' at the base of the Y for quick recall in exams.

## Types of Problems

There are four main categories:

1. **Distance Same**: The object travels the same distance in different scenarios.
2. **Speed Same**: Its speed is unchanged between situations.
3. **Time Same**: The time taken is unchanged.
4. **Average Speed**: Problems requiring the average speed over multiple segments.

Often, the type must be inferred from the question.

## Average Speed

- Formula:  
  `Average Speed = Total Distance ÷ Total Time`

- Total Distance: Sum of all segments.
- Total Time: Add time taken for each segment.

## Worked Examples

### 1. Speed Increase/Decrease with Same Distance

*A boy increases his speed to 9/5 times his original and reaches 30 min early. Usual time?*

- Let normal speed = s, normal time = t  
- Increased speed = (9/5)s, reduced time = t - 30  
- Set up: s × t = (9/5)s × (t - 30)  
- Rearranged: `5t = 9(t - 30)`  
- Solve for t:  
  `5t = 9t - 270`  
  `4t = 270`  
  `t = 67.5` minutes

### 2. Chasing Problems (Same Time Case)

*Ramesh chases a thief at a speed of 7 m/s. Thief starts 80m ahead at 5 m/s. How far till caught?*

- Both run for same time t.
- Let thief covers d, Ramesh covers d + 80.
- Equation: `d / 5 = (d + 80) / 7`  
  Cross-multiplied: `7d = 5d + 400`  
  `2d = 400`  
  `d = 200` m

---

### 3. Relative Speeds in Races

*P, Q, R are in a 4500m cycle race. P cycles twice as fast as Q. R cycles 1/3 as fast as Q. R finishes in 45 min. Where is Q from the finish when P finishes?*

- P covers double Q’s distance in the same time.
- If P covers 4500m, then Q covers `4500 / 2 = 2250` m, so Q is 2250m from finish when P finishes.

### 4. Meeting/Return Problems

*Ajay travels A→B at 17 km/h, Vijay at 19 km/h. B is 72 km from A. Vijay returns and meets Ajay at C. Find B→C distance.*

- Let B→C = x km.
- Ajay: covers A→C (`72 - x` km at 17 km/h)
- Vijay: covers B→C + C→ (returns) (`72 + x` km at 19 km/h)
- Set up:  
  `(72 - x)/17 = (72 + x)/19`  
  Cross-multiplied: `19(72 - x) = 17(72 + x)`  
  `1368 - 19x = 1224 + 17x`  
  `1368 - 1224 = 19x + 17x`  
  `144 = 36x`  
  `x = 4` km

---

### 5. Late/Early Arrival Problems

*Surendra drives home→office (d km). At 50 km/h, 30 min late. At 60 km/h, 10 min early. Find d.*

- Time difference = 30 min + 10 min = 40 min = 2/3 hr
- Equation:  
  `d/50 - d/60 = 2/3`  
  LCD is 300; `6d - 5d = 2/3 (300)`  
  `d = 200` km

---

### 6. Change in Speed, Less Late

*Rohit drives at 30 km/h, late by 20 min; at 45 km/h, late by 8 min. How far?*

- Time difference = 12 min = 0.2 hr
- Equation:  
  `d/30 - d/45 = 0.2`  
  LCD is 90; `3d - 2d = 0.2 * 90`  
  `d = 18` km

---

### 7. Average Speed (Segmented Travel)

*Pratik travels 96 km @ 16 km/h, 124 km @ 31 km/h, 105 km @ 7 km/h. Average speed?*

- Total Distance: `96 + 124 + 105 = 325` km
- Total Time: `96/16 + 124/31 + 105/7 = 6 + 4 + 15 = 25` hrs
- Average Speed: `325 / 25 = 13` km/h

---

### 8. Fractional Distance Segments

*Rohit covers ¼ at 20 km/h, ¼ at 10 km/h, rest at 80 km/h. Find average speed.*

- Assume total distance = d
- Time for:  
  First quarter: `d/4 ÷ 20 = d/80`  
  Second quarter: `d/4 ÷ 10 = d/40`  
  Remaining half: `d/2 ÷ 80 = d/160`
- Total time: `d/80 + d/40 + d/160`  
  LCM is 160, so `(2d + 4d + d)/160 = 7d/160`
- Average speed: `d / (7d/160) = 160/7` km/h

---

### 9. Two People Walk Towards Each Other

*A walks Jammu→Delhi; B walks Delhi→Jammu. After meeting, A needs 361 hrs, B needs 289 hrs. Ratio of speeds?*

- Formula: Speed of A : Speed of B = sqrt(Y) : sqrt(X), where X = A’s time after meeting, Y = B’s time after meeting
- So, `sqrt(289) : sqrt(361) = 17 : 19`

---

### 10. Speed as a Fraction of Actual Speed

*A car at 5/7 its actual speed covers 42 km in 1 hr 40 min 48 sec. Find actual speed.*

- Convert time: 1 hr = 3600 s, 40 min = 2400 s, 48 s ⇒ total = 6048 s
- Distance = 42,000 m
- Let actual speed = s, so running at (5/7)s  
- `(42,000 / 6048) = (5/7)s`  
- Rearranged: `s = (42,000 / 6048) * (7/5)`
- Calculated: `s = 35` km/h

---

## Useful Shortcuts

- Always ensure consistent units (m/s or km/h).
- For time differences, convert minutes to hours when needed.
- Average speed = total distance ÷ total time, even if varying segment speeds.
- For two-person meeting problems, use the square root formula for speed ratio (see Example 9).

---

## Final Tips

- Draw the DST diagram in rough work for formula recall.
- Identify category: same distance, speed, time, or average speed.
- Practice conversion between hours, minutes, seconds, meters, kilometers.
- For placement tests, these shortcuts save crucial time.
