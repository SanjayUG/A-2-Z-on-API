/*
Request Headers
Request Headers are key-value pairs of metadata sent along with the HTTP request (like an envelope containing a letter). They provide the server with context about the request or the client.

User Information: Headers like User-Agent (browser/OS info) and the client's IP address (derived from network headers) are automatically sent by the browser or environment and interpreted by the server.

Common Use: You manually configure headers for things like:

Authorization: Sending a token to prove identity (Authorization: Bearer <token>)

Content Type: Telling the server what format the request body is in (Content-Type: application/json).

Accept: Telling the server what format you expect the response in.

2. Path Variables
Path Variables (or Route Parameters) are essential for identifying a specific resource. They are embedded directly within the URL path.

Format: /resource/value

Usage: Used to retrieve, update, or delete a single, unique item.
