# What is encapsulation?

Encapsulation is the process of binding data and the methods into one single unit without revealing the unnecessary details.

Two types are data binding and data hiding.

Data hiding is a process of hiding unwanted information, such as restricting access to any member of an object by making it private.

Data binding binds the data members and the methods together as a whole.

# What is abstraction?

Abstraction is the method of hiding unnecessary details.

## Can we initiate the abstract class?

We can not instantiate an abstract class because it is abstract and not complete.

When it adds {} parentheses while creating the class the compiler considers it as an anonymous class, where the {} denotes the body of an anonymous class.

Hence we will receive the output, but it won't be because of inheritance.

# What is the fundamental difference between abstraction and encapsulation?

Abstraction is about expressing external simplicity.

Encapsulation is about hiring the internal complexity.
