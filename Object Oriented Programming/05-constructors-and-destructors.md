# What is a constructor and destructor and can we overload them?

A constructor is a block of code similar to methods that is invoked when an instance of an object is created & at the time of calling the constructor memory for the object is allocated.

A destructor is the last function that is called before an object is destroyed.

# What is constructor chaining?

Constructor chaining is the sequence of invoking constructors of the same class upon initializing an object.
