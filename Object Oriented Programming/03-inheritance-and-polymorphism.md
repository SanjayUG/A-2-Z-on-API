# What is inheritance and polymorphism?

With inheritance, a derived class inherits features of an already existing class or the base class.

It's like using the structure and the behavior of a parent class in the child class.

Inheritance can be single, multiple, hierarchical, multipath, or hybrid.

It supports code reusability and reduces the lines of code.

Polymorphism allows methods of the class to exist in multiple forms.

It intends on changing the parent class methods, and it decides which form of the function to be invoked.

Polymorphism has two types: compile-time and run-time polymorphism.

Inheritance is applied to classes, and polymorphism is applied to methods.
