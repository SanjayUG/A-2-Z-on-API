# What is OOPs and why is it important?

OOPs is a programming technique which includes objects instead of functions and procedures.

All objects are grouped into classes.

OOPs integrates real-world concepts into programming such as abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

OOPs reduces redundancy, and it binds code and data together and keeps sensitive data confidential and improves code readability.

Polymorphism gives flexibility to the program by allowing entities to have many forms.
