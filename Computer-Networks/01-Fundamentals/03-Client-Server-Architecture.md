## 3. Client-Server Architecture

### Basic Concept:
- **Client**: Device requesting services (your computer, browser)
- **Server**: Device providing services (Google servers, web servers)
- **Request-Response Model**: Client sends request, server sends response

### Example Process:
1. User types google.com in browser
2. Browser sends HTTP request to Google servers
3. Google server processes request
4. Server sends back HTML, CSS, JavaScript files
5. Browser renders the webpage
